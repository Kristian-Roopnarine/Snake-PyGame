A replica of the game "Snake" created using PyGame.


<h1> How to play </h2>

Clone the respository and run snake.exe in the SnakeGame folder! The game will start pasued and wait for directional key input before moving. The frames are pretty low when you start but the animation looks much better the longer the snake gets. Let me know what your score is!
